#<a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> Application

***

####The sample demo can be found <a href="http://eat36five.herokuapp.com"><b>here</b></a>


##Purpose

Eat36Five is an application <b>that helps people</b> find new spots to eat. The main focus of the app was to highlight FourSquare's developer API's and use Node.js to setup the RESTful API to connect to FourSquare. The application uses best practices when it comes to: <b>folders structure</b>, <b>modularity</b>, <b>organizing navigation</b>, and building <b>a simple interface</b>.

##Stack

* Client: <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> Framework (HTML enhanced for web apps!)
* CSS: [Twitter's bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Backend: <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/">FourSquare API</a>

###Build

* powered by [Gulp.js](http://www.gulpjs.com/)
* build supporting JSLinting, JavaScript and CSS  minification.

##Installation

###Platform & Tools

You need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and then the development tools. Node.js comes with a package manager called [npm](http://npmjs.org) for installing NodeJS applications and libraries.
* [Install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) (requires node.js => v0.12.7)
* [Install bower](http://bower.io/), a depedency package manager.

###Grabbing the code

Either clone this repository or fork it on GitHub

<pre>
* git clone https://github.com/kpingul/SearchSF.git

* cd searchSF
</pre>

### Dependencies

Since the client application is built using AngularJS and other 3rd party libraries, we need to install the local dependencies using [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org).

<b>Bower.json</b>
<pre>
  "bootstrap": "~3.3.5",
  "angular": "~1.4.3",
  "angular-ui-router": "~0.2.15",
  "slick-carousel": "~1.5.8",
  "angular-slick": "~0.2.1",
  "swipebox": "~1.4.1",
  "angular-mocks": "~1.4.3",
  "bower": "*",
  "install": "~1.0.4",
</pre>
* To Install the front end dependencies run:
<pre> <a href="http://bower.io">bower</a> install</pre>

(This will install the dependencies declared in the /bower.json file)

<b>Package.json</b>
<pre>
  "gulp-concat": "^2.6.0",
  "gulp-jshint": "^1.11.2",
  "gulp-minify-css": "^1.2.0",
  "gulp-rename": "^1.2.2",
  "gulp-uglify": "^1.2.0",
  "jshint-stylish": "^2.0.1"

</pre>

* To install our npm dependencies for our build system and server, run: 
<pre><a href="https://www.npmjs.com">npm</a> install </pre>

(This will install the dependencies declared in the /package.json file)

##Running the server

* Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the server by running the gulp default task: 

<pre><a href="http://www.gulpjs.com">gulp</a></pre>

* Once it brings up the server, you can start browsing through the application at http://localhost:3000
 
 
##Browser Support
 
AngularJS and Bootstrap will work with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera, as well as Internet Explorer version 9, 10, and 11. As for IE8 and below, you might have to work some magic.

Swipe Box + Slick: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, IE9+, IOS4+, Android, windows phone.

##Development

###Folders Structure

<img src="http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k34/kdiggz415/seachSfFolderStructure.png" />

So far, The folder structure for this application is sorted by features rather by type. But, this time. instead of placing all controllers/templates/ ect into the folder, I divided them by each type to make it more easier to navigate through. 

###Features

Features include:
 
<ul> 
<li>Lightbox that showcases each of the venues photos.</li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/">Google Maps </a>to highlight the location of each venue.</li>
</ul>

Here are the dependencies that I'm using to make those features come alive: 
<pre>
angular.module('myApp', [
	'ui.router', 
	 'slick'
]);

</pre>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router">angular-ui-router</a> to allow the dyamic routing and SPA experience.</li>

<li><a href="http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/">slickSlider</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Ken Wheeler">Ken Wheeler</a> for the image carousel provided throughout the application.</li>

</ul>

<b>jQuery Plugins</b>
